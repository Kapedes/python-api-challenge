# python-api-challenge

Using Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?" using a Python script to visualise the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator.

Part 1 : WeatherPy

Create Plots to Showcase the Relationship Between Weather Variables and Latitude:

 - Latitude vs. Temperature

- Latitude vs. Humidity

- Latitude vs. Cloudiness

- Latitude vs. Wind Speed

Compute Linear Regression for Each Relationship detail above for both Northern and Southern Hemisphere. 


Part 2: Vacation Py

Creating a map that displays a point for every city in the city_data_df DataFrame as shown in the following image. The size of the point should be the humidity in each city.

Narrow down the city_data_df DataFrame to find your ideal weather condition.
